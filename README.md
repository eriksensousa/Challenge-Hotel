# Hotel Management System In Java

Hotel management system is a free and open source project. This application is pretty simple and easy to use. The whole system is built in Java programming language with the help of NetBeans IDE. Also to make records available for future use itâ€™s back-end is Sqlite database. This is simple yet complete hotel management system. This system performs all the necessary tasks that a hotel software application performs.

## About The Project

Talking about the system, it lacks one basic thing that is the login panel for the administrator. You can simply add the login panel to make it more secure and private. The system is all from the admin side. Admin has the full access to the system. The user can only book and reserve hotel rooms. The user can either book room which is paid, or can reserve the room for later confirmation or simply can book rooms. After that, then the user can make payments and the admin and the application generates the payment invoice.

Not only this the admin can easily add rooms and its services types. The admin can create many other facilities required for the guests in a hotel. Also, the user can book other miscellaneous activities in the hotel booking system. As a whole, this system is very much effective and user-friendly.

### Introduction

The Hotel Management System is a software application designed to help hotels manage their operations more efficiently. The system is built using the Java programming language and is designed to be simple and easy to use. The goal of this project is to implement a complete hotel management system that can handle tasks such as managing reservations, payments, rooms, services, and facilities.

### Background

Managing a hotel can be a complex and challenging task. There are many different aspects to consider, such as managing reservations, handling payments, keeping track of room availability, and providing services and facilities to guests. A hotel management system can help streamline these tasks and improve the efficiency and quality of hotel operations.

### Design

The Hotel Management System is designed using an object-oriented approach. The system is divided into several modules, each responsible for handling a specific aspect of hotel operations. For example, there is a module for managing reservations, another for handling payments, and another for keeping track of room availability.

The system uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it easy for users to interact with the system. The GUI is built using the Java Swing library and provides a user-friendly interface for performing tasks such as making reservations, checking in guests, and generating reports.

The system also uses a database to store information about reservations, payments, rooms, services, and facilities. The database is implemented using SQLite, which is a lightweight and easy-to-use database management system.

### Implementation

The Hotel Management System is implemented using the Java programming language. The system is developed using the NetBeans IDE, which provides tools for writing, compiling, and debugging Java code.

The system uses several libraries and frameworks to implement its functionality. For example, the system uses the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API to connect to the SQLite database and perform database operations. The system also uses the Java Swing library to build its graphical user interface.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the Hotel Management System is a complete software application designed to help hotels manage their operations more efficiently. The system is built using the Java programming language and uses an object-oriented design approach. The system provides a user-friendly interface for performing tasks such as managing reservations, handling payments, and keeping track of room availability. Overall, the Hotel Management System is an effective tool for improving the efficiency and quality of hotel operations.
